                If I were to tell you about my whole Navy experience I think this page would turn into a novel, 
                so let me tell you briefly about what I did in the Navy.
            </p>
            <p class="p_general">
                On August 27, 2013 I began bootcamp in Great Lakes, Illinois.
                In bootcamp I was took on a leadership position in my division. 
                As the administrative leader and I organized everyone's file and paperwork, 
                and planned schedule so that they were ready to be presented when the executive leaders asked about each individual's report.
                Eight weeks later, I completed my basic training and I was sent to Meridian, Mississippi to complete my Logistics Specialists School.
                While at the Logistics Specialists School studied supply chain management, accounting, finance, and operations.
                The software I used in the Navy was called Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS).
                Through NALCOMIS we purchased materials, parts, supplies, etc. we built requisitions; performed ad-hoc analysis; pooled data; 
                planned servicing and organized maintenance schedule.
            </p>
            <p class="p_general">
                On February 19, 2014 I landed in Japan and reported to Atsugi, Japan to perform my duties as a Logistics Specialist.
                I was extremely nervous and didn't know what to expect nor what was going to be expected of me.
                I was as nervous as anyone on their first job after college.
                Even though I learned how to be a Logistics Specialist and how to procure items and how to perform ad-hoc queries, but what if I don't have the right answer?
