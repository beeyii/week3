        If I were to tell you about my whole Navy experience I think this page would turn into a novel, so let me tell you briefly about my Navy experience.
        <br>
        On August 27, 2013 I began bootcamp in Great Lakes, Illinois.
        In bootcamp I was given the leadership position in my division. 
        I was the administrative leader and made sure everyone's file and paperwork were ready to go when the executive leaders asked about each individual's report.
        Eight weeks later, I completed my basic training and I was sent to Meridian, Mississippi to complete my Logistics Specialists School.
        While at the Logistics Specialists School studied supply chain management, accounting, finance, and operations.
        The software I used in the Navy was called Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS).
        Through NALCOMIS we purchased materials, parts, supplies, etc. we built requisitions; performed ad-hoc analysis; pooled data; 
        planned servicing and organized maintenance schedule.
        <br>
        On February 19, 2014 I landed in Japan to perform my duties as a Logistics Specialist.
        I was extremely nervous and did not know what to expect and what was going to be expected of me.
        I was as nervous as anyone on their first job after college.
        Even though I learned how to be a Logistics Specialist and how to procure items and how to perform ad-hoc queries, but what if I don't have the right answer?
