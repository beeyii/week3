            Hi, I'm Brian Yi.
            <br>
            I'm Korean-American from New Jersey.

            Childhood
        </h2>
        <p class="p_general">
            I was born in New Brunswick, NJ in the spring of 1991.
            When I was three years old my family moved to South Korea to take care of my grandparents, who suddenly became ill.
            So... you've guessed it Korean was my first language despite being born in the United States.
            In Korea, I grew up near the capital of South Korea, Seoul and attended a public elementary school just like rest of the kids.
            In second grade, I ran for class president and I was selected; however, my presidency came to an end when both of my grandparents passed and my parents decided to move back to the States.
            Although, I only served as the class president for few months, I began developing leadership skills at the age of seven.

            <strong><u>College</u></strong>
        </h2>
        <p class="p_general">
            In 2009, I enrolled at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor as an engineering student.
            I began my journey at the University of Michigan with the plan of becoming a dentist or a surgeon, which has been my dream since fifth grade.
