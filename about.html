                Childhood
            </h2>
            <p class="p_general">
                I was born in New Brunswick, NJ in the spring of 1991.
                When I was three years old my family moved to South Korea to take care of my grandparents, who suddenly became ill.
                So... you've guessed it Korean was my first language despite being born in the United States.
                In Korea, I grew up near the capital of South Korea, Seoul and attended a public elementary school just like rest of the kids.
                In second grade, I ran for class president and I was elected; 
                however, my presidency came to an end only few months after when both of my grandparents passed and my parents decided to move back to the States.
                Although, I only served as the class president for few months, I was already beginning to develop my leadership skills at the age of seven.

                College Round 1
            </h2>
            <p class="p_general">
                In 2009, I enrolled at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor as an engineering student in the College of Engineering.
                I began my journey at the University of Michigan with the plan of becoming a dentist or a surgeon, which has been my dream ever since fifth grade.
                But once I began taking programming classes and calculus that dream began to scrumble.
                I still remember the letter I received from the University of Michigan's Admissions Office.
                The letter stated that they had never seen a student who has applied to the College of Engineering without having taken physics and 
                they suggested that I take it somewhere before I begin my semester at the University of Michigan.
                However, I was not able to register for physics in my senior year because my semester had already begun.
                I eventually decided to pursue Industrial and Operations Engineering as my major in hopes of becoming a consultant or go into supply chain management with pre-med.
                Even with a goal in mind, I just struggled because I couldn't imagine how I can use calculus and physics to consult a client about their issues or to make supply chain more streamlined.
                So, every engineering course I took felt like a drag and I just couldn't ask anyone for help because I was afraid to be judged and I felt like I had to figure it out on my own.
                Then I began pushing aside my none engineering courses to try to spend as much time as I could on the engineering courses, which results in decline of grades for all my classes.
                Once my GPA began taking a huge hit, I began to lose confidence and my morale just went down the drain.
                I began questions why I was studying engineering and began to really despise school.
                Is it just to get that diploma? Is it to satisfy my parents?
